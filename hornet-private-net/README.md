# Private Tangle Setup using Hornet

You can also use these scripts under the [AWS Marketplace](./README_AWS.md)

## Usage

* Make the bash script executable by running
```
chmod +x private-tangle.sh
```

* Install a new Tangle with Coordinator, Spammer and 1 Node

*Warning: It destroys previous data.* 

```
./private-tangle.sh install <coo_bootstrap_wait_time>
```

The parameter `coo_bootstrap_wait_time` is optional (default is `10` seconds) and denotes the time in seconds to wait for the coordinator to bootstrap.

* Stop all the containers by running 

```
./private-tangle.sh stop
```

* Start all the containers by running 

```
./private-tangle.sh start
```


* Add extra Nodes to your Private Tangle

Go to the `extra-nodes` folder and follow the recipe [here](./extra-nodes/README.md).

## Notes on IOTA Frameworks

If you want to use [IOTA Identity](https://github.com/identity.rs) on your Private Tangle you can do it by assigning the network identifier `tangle` to the DID method used, for instance `did:iota:tangle:F7PAPm2LqngmmN2uu3DSmHAvu74zA5f8c7c9R75qnMkG`. A DID generation Rust example can be found [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/dev/examples/low-level-api/private_tangle.rs). 

Note: If you install the Tangle Explorer the Identity Resolver will be enabled by default. The URL to inspect your generated DIDs will be typically of the form `http://localhost:8082/tangle/identity-resolver/{DID}`, for instance `http://localhost:8082/tangle/identity-resolver/did:iota:tangle:F7PAPm2LqngmmN2uu3DSmHAvu74zA5f8c7c9R75qnMkG`

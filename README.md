## About

This repository is where the IOTA Foundation hosts the open-source code for deploying IOTA Nodes and Networks "in one click".

The code is composed of:

- [**`private-tangle`:**](private-tangle/README.md) Script to deploy a new Private Tangle composed of Coordinator, Spammer and one regular Hornet Node. 
- [**`explorer`:**](explorer/README.md) Script to deploy a new [Tangle Explorer](https://github.com/iotaledger/explorer).
- [**`bootstrap`:**](bootstrap/README.md) Scripts that support full IOTA's Private Tangle Deployment on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08M4933Y3).

This is beta software, so there may be issues.
Please report any issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iotaledger/one-click-tangle/issues/new).

## Prerequisites

To execute these scripts you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and Docker Compose. **Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. A series [YAML files](./docker-compose.yaml) are used to configure the required services. This means all container services can be brought up in a single command. Docker Compose is installed by default as part of Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac, however Linux users will need to follow the instructions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You can check your current **Docker** and **Docker Compose** versions using the following commands:

```console
docker-compose -v
docker version
```

Please ensure that you are using Docker version `18.03` or higher and Docker Compose `1.21` or higher and upgrade if
necessary.

## Getting started

First you need to clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/one-click-tangle
```

Afterwards you can install a Private Tangle with Merkle Tree Depth of `16` by

```
cd hornet-private-net
chmod +x private-tangle.sh
./private-tangle.sh start 16
```

The depth of the Merkle Tree determines how many milestones the Coordinator can issue. For instance, with a Merkle Tree of depth `16` and a Coordinator issuing a confirmation milestone every `10` seconds you could run a Tangle for just `7` days. The deeper the Merkle Tree the longer it will take to create it and bootstrap the Private Tangle. 

You may also want to [deploy a Tangle Explorer](./explorer). 

Additional instructions can be found on this [tutorial](https://docs.iota.org/docs/hornet/1.1/tutorials/one-click-private-tangle).
